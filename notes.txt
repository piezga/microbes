I have both weighted and binary data.

The packages from Saracco et al. work well. It is possible to fit the BiCM rather
quickly.
The current problem lies in the distribution of p-values. It is heavily skewed towards 1,
leading to an empty projection. What does it mean to be skewed towards 1?

Memo: the p-value is the probability of observing a number of V-motifs greater than, 
or equal to, the observed one.

So a distribution skewed towards 1 means that we are almost certain to observe at least
the observed amount of V motifs under the null hypothesis. Keyword being "at least":
we are doing a one-tail statistical test. From the paper: 


"As a final remark, notice that this approach describes a one-tail statistical test, 
where nodes are considered as
significantly similar if, and only if, the observed number of shared neighbors is 
‘sufficiently large’. In principle,
our algorithm can be also used to carry out the reverse validation, linking any two 
nodes if the observed number
of shared neighbors is ‘sufficiently small’: this second type of validation can be 
performed whenever interested in
highlighting the ‘dissimilarity’ between nodes."

This is like saying that we would be expecting even more links than what we observe


Hypothesis 1: are the species so omnipresent that it is expected for them to have a p 
skewed towards 1?
